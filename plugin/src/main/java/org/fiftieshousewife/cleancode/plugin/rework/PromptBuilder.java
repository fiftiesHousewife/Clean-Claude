                    accumulate output (F2) — return a value or use a local buffer.

                    Optional if the value is genuinely optional.

                    SLF4J on the classpath; append to an existing audit List<String> or
                    fold the error into the return type.

                IMPORTANT CONTEXT — this file has ALREADY been processed by the deterministic
                refactoring recipes before you received it. The Findings section at the bottom
                of this prompt has been RE-GENERATED after the recipe pass, so every finding
                listed is still live. You will not see findings for changes the recipes
                already made; do not spend turns looking for work that isn't there. The
                following classes of change are done already:
                  • G18 methods with no instance state have already been made static.
                  • G29 sibling guard clauses with identical bodies have already been merged.
                  • G30/G33 `if (v > CAP) v = CAP;` idioms are already `Math.min(v, CAP);`.
                  • G30 retry-style `for` loops that append a constant have already been
                    rewritten as `list.addAll(Collections.nCopies(n, x));`.
                  • G31 consecutive fluent-builder calls on the same receiver are chained.
                  • G34 `// Phase N:` and `// Step N:` section markers are gone.
                  • Ch7.1 `catch (InterruptedException)` blocks now restore the interrupt flag.

                Your job is the REMAINING findings — the ones the recipes can't do:
                  • Converting output-argument mutations to return values (F2).
                  • Splitting flag-argument methods that dispatch on a boolean (F3).
                  • Replacing if/else-if string ladders with enums (G23).
                  • Converting imperative loops to streams where the body does more than
                    a constant add (G30).
                  • Naming extracted helpers, choosing record shapes, and any finding
                    that is a judgement call.

                      — batch extraction. Applies every range in one tool call,
                        transactionally (all-or-nothing). Internally bottom-up so the
                        line numbers you pass always refer to the ORIGINAL file.
                        PREFER THIS when you have 2+ extractions planned on the same file
                        — it collapses N turns of context into one and keeps line numbers
                        mentally stable for you.

                  extract_method(file, startLine, endLine, newMethodName)

                        to do on a file; otherwise use extract_methods.

                      Both extract tools share the same preconditions:
                        USE them when ALL of these hold:
                          • The fix is a pure statement-range extraction — pulling a
                            contiguous run of top-level statements into a helper, with no
                            other change.
                          • The range is ≥ 3 statements and a cohesive phase (e.g. a
                            section of a too-long method, a loop body, a guard block).
                          • The change does NOT also convert mutation to return, does NOT
                            introduce a record return type, and does NOT change access
                            modifiers.

                        The presence of stylistic findings on the SAME file is NOT a reason
                        to skip the extraction — do the extraction with the recipe, then fix
                        the stylistic findings with Edit on the resulting file. Treat the two
                        independently.

                        DO NOT use extract_method when the finding ITSELF is stylistic:
                          • G12 FQN, G18 static-modifier, G22 missing-final, G25
                            repeated-string, J1 unused-import — those are one-line Edits.
                            (Stylistic findings don't call for extraction on their own; but
                            their presence on a file doesn't block an unrelated extraction.)
                          • The finding calls for converting an output parameter to a
                            return value (F2) — use Edit, rewrite the signature.
                          • The finding calls for stream conversion (G30 loop→stream) —
                            use Edit with a .stream() pipeline.
                          • The method is already short (< 15 lines) with no clear
                            sub-phase — there is nothing to extract.

                  verify_build(module)
                      — `./gradlew :<module>:compileJava` → `build OK` or a compact error.
                  run_tests(module, testClass?)

                  format(module)
                      — `./gradlew :<module>:spotlessApply`; call once at the end.

                Call extract_methods (batch) when you have ≥2 extractions planned on one
                file; otherwise call extract_method. Fall back to Edit for everything else.

                If either extract tool returns ANY error — including "recipe rejected the
